# Apple Human Interface Guidelines

Follow these Apple platform conventions for all UI work in this project. The goal is to make the app feel native — like it belongs on the platform.

## Typography

- Use the system font (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, or `SF Pro` via `font-family: system-ui`)
- Use San Francisco's built-in text styles for hierarchy:
  - Large Title: 34pt, bold
  - Title 1: 28pt, bold
  - Title 2: 22pt, bold
  - Title 3: 20pt, semibold
  - Headline: 17pt, semibold
  - Body: 17pt, regular
  - Callout: 16pt, regular
  - Subhead: 15pt, regular
  - Footnote: 13pt, regular
  - Caption 1: 12pt, regular
  - Caption 2: 11pt, regular
- Use SF Mono for code and monospaced content
- Support Dynamic Type — use relative sizing so text scales with user preferences

## Icons

- Use SF Symbols as the primary icon set — they match the system aesthetic and scale with text
- SF Symbols have 9 weights and 3 scales — match icon weight to adjacent text weight
- Use filled variants for selected/active states, outlined for inactive
- For tab bars: use filled icons for the selected tab, outlined for unselected
- Maintain consistent icon sizes within the same context (toolbar, list rows, etc.)

## Colors

- Use Apple's semantic system colors which adapt to light/dark mode automatically:
  - Labels: `labelColor`, `secondaryLabelColor`, `tertiaryLabelColor`, `quaternaryLabelColor`
  - Backgrounds: `systemBackground`, `secondarySystemBackground`, `tertiarySystemBackground`
  - System colors: `systemBlue`, `systemGreen`, `systemRed`, etc.
- Use the system accent color for primary actions — respects user's accent color preference
- Support both light and dark appearance — test in both
- Use vibrancy and translucency where appropriate (sidebars, toolbars)

## Navigation

### macOS
- Use a sidebar for top-level navigation in document or collection-based apps
- Toolbar at the top for actions — use the system toolbar style
- Use the standard window controls (close, minimize, zoom) — never hide or move them
- Support the menu bar — common actions should be accessible from menus with keyboard shortcuts
- Use sheets for modal input, popovers for contextual info, alerts only for critical decisions

### iOS
- Use a tab bar for top-level navigation (max 5 items)
- Use `NavigationStack` for hierarchical drilling down
- Swipe-back gesture must always work for navigation
- Pull-to-refresh for updating content
- Use standard toolbar positions: navigation bar at top, tab bar at bottom, toolbar above keyboard

## Layout

- Respect safe areas — never place interactive content under the notch, home indicator, or status bar
- Use standard margins: 16pt on compact width, 20pt on regular width
- Align content to the system layout margins
- Use list insets and grouped table styles for settings-like screens
- Support all orientations unless there's a strong reason not to

## Interaction

- Use standard gestures: tap, long press, swipe, pinch, rotate
- Provide haptic feedback for significant actions (iOS)
- Support context menus (right-click on macOS, long press on iOS)
- Use standard selection patterns: single tap to select, edit mode for multi-select
- Destructive actions should be red and require confirmation

## Platform Conventions

- Use native controls (buttons, toggles, sliders, pickers) — don't build custom versions of system components
- Match the system's corner radius for cards and containers (10pt on iOS, varies on macOS)
- Use the standard alert/action sheet patterns for confirmations
- Support Handoff, drag and drop, and other system integration features where relevant
- Follow the app lifecycle conventions: save state on background, restore on foreground
